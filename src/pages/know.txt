const handleInputEnter=(e)=>{
    console.log('event',e.code);
  };

  This was taking all keys as events but we only wanted to receive "enter"

Socket#id:
Each new connection is assigned a random 20-characters identifier.
This identifier is synced with the value on the client-side.


Was unable to get the websocket connected due to not starting the node server, this was further rectified and was able to generate a unique socket id for the website
To debug this various methods were used 
I hard coded the port - 5000 and checked the url was working or not
We added error handling to check for the location where it was failing
